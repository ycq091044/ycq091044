### Hi there 👋, this is <u>Chaoqi YANG (杨超琪 in Chinese)</u>.

I work in a Fintech firm now. I obtained my PhD at UIUC, BE at SJTU.

- 🏥 I’m leading the long-term development of [PyHealth](https://pyhealth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- Currently, I am also drafting a textbook with my PhD advisor and other collaborators. It is about how to apply different deep learning models on specific healthcare data and applications.
- ✈️ I like gym, hiking, sports, and travels. I maintained (irregularly) a [photo collection](https://500px.com/p/ycqsjtu).
