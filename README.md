### Hi there 👋, this is <u>Chaoqi YANG (杨超琪 in Chinese)</u>.

A final-year PhD student of computer science at UIUC. Here is my [homepage](https://ycq091044.github.io/).

- 📆 We are hosting the [Harmful Brain Activity Classification Contest](https://bdsp-core.github.io/Seizures-and-Harmful-Brain-Activity/). Join to win $10,000!
- ✈️ I like gym, hiking, sports, and travels. I maintained (irregularly) a [photo collection](https://500px.com/p/ycqsjtu).
